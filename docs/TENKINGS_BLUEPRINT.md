Introduction

TenKings aims to create a physical-digital collectible ecosystem similar to platforms like Courtyard and Arena Club, but with its own twist.  Collectors primarily pay for packs and cards with their credit or debit cards.  TenKings Dollars (TKD) are issued only when a collector accepts an instant buyback or receives proceeds from a marketplace sale, and they cannot be purchased directly with fiat.  Once credited, TKD may be used as a secondary payment option for future purchases within the platform.  TKD never leave the TenKings environment: they are a closed-loop digital asset that can only be spent on TenKings products.  This design aligns with regulatory guidance on closed-loop virtual currencies, which notes that such assets “can only be used as payment within a particular virtual environment” and “cannot be sold or exchanged for fiat outside of the game”kpmg.com.  By keeping TKD on a private ledger and issuing them solely through buybacks and sales, TenKings retains full control over issuance, transfers and redemption.  To streamline onboarding of new items, TenKings will integrate with an external card-scanning service.  High-resolution photos of incoming cards will be processed through KingsCardProcessor using machine-vision APIs (Ximilar’s Card Identifier and Google Vision) to extract metadata and suggested values; staff will review these results before cards are vaulted and listed.
To build TenKings, we analysed the strengths of Courtyard (secure vaulting, cryptographic proof of integrity, instant buyback, digital packs and marketplace) and Arena Club (grading service, asset-backed NFTs, showroom social features) and distilled the features most relevant to our goals.  TenKings will adopt secure vault storage and a transparent ownership ledger like Courtyard’s proof-of-integrity systemdocs.courtyard.io, and will offer an instant buyback like Courtyard’s 80–90 % buyback option.  However, TenKings will forgo its own grading service (no AI grading like Arena Club) and instead focus on instant liquidity and ease of use.

Core Features

2209. Secure vault – TenKings will operate or partner with a secure, insured vault to store all physical collectibles.  Each card or item will be catalogued with a unique identifier and high-resolution photographs, similar to Courtyard’s item fingerprinting processdocs.courtyard.io.  The vault ensures that all marketplace trades are settled without shipping delays.
2210. Digital representation – Each vaulted item is represented in the TenKings system by a unique digital record.  Unlike Courtyard’s ERC-721 NFTs or Arena Club’s DPOC, TenKings will store these records in its own database rather than on a public blockchain.  The record includes the item’s fingerprint, metadata, ownership history and a pointer to vault inventory.
2211. TenKings Dollars (TKD) – An internal currency that can only be spent on TenKings services and products.  TKD are not sold directly to users; they are credited only when a collector accepts TenKings’ instant buyback offer or receives proceeds from a marketplace sale.  Once credited, collectors may spend TKD on digital or physical packs instead of using their credit card.  TKD cannot be withdrawn, exchanged for fiat or transferred outside TenKings (meeting closed-loop criteriakpmg.com).  TKD is not asset-backed; it functions like store credit and does not convey ownership of any collectible.
2212. Card ingestion & scanning integration – TenKings will integrate with a card-scanning web service (e.g., KingsCardProcessor) that uses image recognition and OCR technologies such as Ximilar’s Card Identifier API and Google Vision.  When a physical card arrives at the vault, staff (or an external app) take high-resolution photos and submit them to the scanning service.  Ximilar’s Card Identifier can recognize trading cards from any image and return attributes like the card’s name, set, series, code, number, release year and whether it is holo/foilximilar.com.  The service can also generate keywords and return data in JSON for easy processingximilar.com.  These attributes help TenKings automatically populate metadata, estimate market value and link to external price guidesximilar.com.  An internal Card Ingestion Service will receive the scan results, store them in the database and queue the item for staff approval.  Admins can review the photo, metadata and suggested value, adjust as needed, and approve the item for vaulting and marketplace listing.  This integration ensures accurate cataloguing and consistent valuations while leaving final control with TenKings staff.
2213. Digital packs and vending machines – TenKings will offer random digital packs purchasable with TKD on the website or mobile app.  Physical packs can be purchased from TenKings vending machines using TKD via a QR code or account login.  Pack odds and supply will be transparently published.
2214. Marketplace – Collectors can list their vaulted items for sale priced in TKD.  Buyers must have sufficient TKD balance.  When a sale occurs, the item’s digital ownership is transferred instantly and the seller’s balance increases.  Only items in the TenKings vault can be listed, ensuring quick settlement.
2215. Instant buyback – At any time, TenKings will offer to buy back vaulted items at 80 % of TenKings’ current market value.  The valuation is determined by TenKings’ pricing engine (see below).  If a user accepts the offer, TKD are credited to their account and the item becomes TenKings inventory.
2216. Redemption – Users may redeem their item by requesting shipment and paying a retrieval fee in TKD.  Upon redemption, the digital record is marked as “shipped” and removed from the marketplace.

High‑Level Architecture

Components

6048. User Interface (Web & Mobile) – Provides registration, KYC/AML compliance, wallet management, pack purchase, marketplace browsing, buy/sell actions, instant buyback and redemption requests.
6049. Wallet Service & Ledger – Core module responsible for creating user accounts, maintaining TKD balances and processing transfers.  It enforces business rules: TKD cannot be withdrawn or transferred to external systems, only spent on authorised actions.  This closed-loop currency design prevents speculation and ensures complianceblog.sui.io.
6050. Vault & Inventory Service – Manages physical items in the vault.  Stores item fingerprints, photos, grading data (if available), and ownership status.  When a pack is opened or a marketplace sale occurs, this service updates the item’s status and links the digital record to the new owner.
6051. Marketplace Service – Handles listings, bidding (if implemented), direct purchases and instant buyback operations.  It interacts with the Wallet Service to debit/credit TKD and with the Vault & Inventory Service to transfer item ownership.
6052. Pricing Engine – Calculates current “market value” for each item.  Inputs might include recent marketplace sales, external price guides, and rarity data.  It produces the value used for instant buyback (80 %) and recommended listing prices.  The algorithm can be updated regularly and is owned by TenKings.
6053. Pack Generation Service – Manages pack contents (digital and physical).  Defines pack tiers, probabilities and ensures fairness, similar to Arena Club’s audited pack shuffle process.  When a user buys a pack, it randomly selects items from inventory, updates the Vault & Inventory Service and notifies the user of their pulls.
6054. Card Ingestion Service & Scanner Integration – A dedicated microservice that integrates with KingsCardProcessor (or a similar scanning web app) to ingest card images and metadata.  It exposes a secure API endpoint for uploading card photos and uses third-party AI services such as Ximilar’s Card Identifier and Google Vision to extract card attributes.  Ximilar can recognise cards from images and return details like name, set, series, code, number, release year and foil statusximilar.com and can deliver results in JSONximilar.com.  The service stores the scanned metadata, estimated market values and associated images, and queues each item for manual review.  Once approved via the admin portal, the service registers the item with the Vault & Inventory Service and updates pricing data for use by the Pricing Engine.
6055. Vending Machine Integration – A lightweight API or mobile app interface used by TenKings vending machines.  Machines can verify a user’s TKD balance via a QR code or token, initiate a charge through the Wallet Service and dispense the selected physical pack.  Inventory is managed in the central system.
6056. Admin Portal – Allows TenKings staff to manage inventory, set pack configurations, update pricing algorithms, approve or reject scanned items, process KYC reviews, handle disputes and monitor system health.

Data Flow (simplified)

9256. Card ingestion & scanning:
	- When a new physical card arrives, a high-resolution photo is taken and submitted to KingsCardProcessor.  The external service uses Ximilar’s Card Identifier and Google Vision to recognise the card and return metadata (name, set, series, code, number, release year, holo status etc.)ximilar.com.  It may also suggest a market value based on external price guidesximilar.com.
	- The Card Ingestion Service receives the scan results, stores the image and metadata, and adds the card to a “pending” queue for staff review.  An administrator uses the Admin Portal to verify the information and adjust the suggested value if necessary.  Once approved, the card is registered in the Vault & Inventory Service and becomes eligible for packs and marketplace listings.
9257. User receives TKD (buyback or sale):
	- When a user accepts TenKings’ instant buyback offer or sells a vaulted item on the marketplace, the Marketplace Service credits their TKD balance through the Wallet Service.  There is no direct purchase of TKD with fiat.
9258. User buys pack (digital):
	- User selects a pack.  They are presented with two payment options: pay with credit/debit card or pay with their TKD balance.  If they choose TKD, the Marketplace Service requests the Wallet Service to check and debit their balance.  The Pack Generation Service allocates random items, the Vault & Inventory Service updates ownership of selected items, and the user is notified of the outcome.
9259. User buys pack (vending machine):
	- At the vending machine, the user scans a QR code or enters credentials.  They can pay with a credit/debit card (primary option) or use TKD (secondary option).  The machine calls the Vending Machine API to check TKD balance if that option is selected; upon payment, the machine dispenses the pack and the Wallet Service debits TKD (if used).  The Vault & Inventory Service reduces pack inventory accordingly.
9260. Marketplace sale:
	- Buyer initiates purchase; Marketplace Service ensures buyer’s TKD balance; if sufficient, it debits buyer, credits seller and updates item ownership in Vault & Inventory Service.
9261. Instant buyback:
	- User selects “Sell to TenKings”; Pricing Engine provides current market value; Marketplace Service debits TenKings’ house account, credits the user 80 % of that value in TKD and moves the item into TenKings inventory.
9262. Redemption:
	- User requests physical delivery; Marketplace Service initiates retrieval, charges retrieval fee in TKD, updates item status to “shipped,” and coordinates shipping.  Upon shipment, the digital record is marked as redeemed and cannot be sold or transferred further.

Security & Compliance Considerations

- Closed-loop currency: TKD must not be redeemable for cash or other tokens; terms of use should state that TKD may only be used within TenKings for specific goods and services, aligning with closed-loop asset definitionskpmg.com.
- KYC/AML: Identity verification is critical; restrict market participation and TKD purchases to verified users.
- Audit trails: Maintain logs of all TKD transactions and item ownership transfers; this ensures transparency and facilitates dispute resolution.  Even though TKD and items are stored off-chain, you can adopt a cryptographic “fingerprint” approach like Courtyard’s proof of integrity to ensure each item’s identity cannot be altered after listingdocs.courtyard.iodocs.courtyard.io.
- Insurance: Vault must be insured against loss or damage.  Clear terms should state the responsibilities and liabilities of TenKings and the user.
- User consent: Provide legal agreements similar to Courtyard’s NFT Terms, clarifying that TKD are licenses to use the platform’s services and that the underlying collectibles remain the property of the token holder until redeemed.
- Data privacy & third-party integrations: When using external AI services to scan cards (KingsCardProcessor, Ximilar, Google Vision), ensure that user data and images are transmitted securely.  Inform users that images of their cards will be processed by third-party machine-vision services for identification and valuation.  Review vendor contracts to ensure they adhere to privacy and data retention requirements.

Development Plan

Below is a step-by-step plan to guide ChatGPT-5 Codex in building the TenKings platform.  Each step assumes that back-end, front-end and infrastructure code can be generated by Codex and that subject matter experts will handle operational details like vault management and legal compliance.
14005. Set up repository and project structure.  Create a monorepo with separate folders for front-end (React/Next.js), back-end services (Node.js with Express or Python FastAPI), and infrastructure (Docker, Terraform, CI/CD).
14006. Design database schemas.  Use PostgreSQL or another relational database to store users, wallets, transactions, item metadata, pack definitions and marketplace listings.  Define relationships: each item record references a vault ID and owner ID; each TKD transaction references a user and an action (purchase, sale, buyback, redemption).
14007. Implement Wallet Service.  Provide REST or GraphQL endpoints to credit, debit and transfer TKD.  Enforce closed-loop rules (no withdrawals) and ensure that TKD can only be credited through instant buybacks or marketplace sales.  There is no direct purchase of TKD with fiat.  The Wallet Service should still support payment processing for pack purchases via credit/debit card by coordinating with the payment gateway.
14008. Implement Card Ingestion Service & Scanner Integration.  Build a microservice that accepts card image uploads and communicates with KingsCardProcessor.  Use Ximilar’s Card Identifier API and Google Vision to extract card attributes and suggested valuations, storing results and images in the database.  Add an approval queue where administrators can review, edit and approve card metadata before it is registered with the Vault & Inventory Service.  Provide authentication and error handling for calls to the external scanning service.
14009. Implement Vault & Inventory Service.  Create endpoints to add new items (after approval), update ownership, mark items as redeemed or sold, and provide fingerprint generation logic (hash descriptions and IDs for tamper-proofingdocs.courtyard.io).
14010. Implement Marketplace Service.  Include APIs for listing items, buying/selling items, instant buyback and redemption.  Connect to Wallet Service to handle payments and to Vault & Inventory Service to transfer ownership.
14011. Implement Pack Generation Service.  Store pack templates and contents; create an API to allocate random items on purchase; ensure randomness and fairness (optionally using third-party auditors for transparency, similar to Arena Club’s audited shuffle).
14012. Implement Vending Machine API.  Expose endpoints for vending machines to authenticate users, check balances and process purchases.  Provide a simple QR code authentication or token-based login for customers at the machine.
14013. Implement Pricing Engine.  Use historical sales and external data sources to compute market value for each item.  Provide APIs for instant buyback valuations.  Ensure values are updated regularly and consistently applied.
14014. Build Front-End Applications.  Develop responsive web and mobile interfaces.  Features include user registration and login, KYC submission, wallet management, pack purchase, item browsing, listing items for sale, accepting buyback offers and requesting redemption.  Add pages or modals for administrative review of scanned cards, displaying the image, extracted metadata and suggested price, with controls to edit and approve.
14015. Admin Tools.  Create internal dashboards for staff to manage vault inventory, update pack configurations, adjust pricing rules, review and approve scanned cards, monitor transactions, and respond to customer support requests.
14016. Testing & Deployment.  Write unit and integration tests.  Use CI/CD pipelines to automatically build, test and deploy services.  Deploy services to a secure cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP or Azure) and configure autoscaling, logging and monitoring.
14017. Roll-out & Iteration.  Launch a beta version with a limited user group.  Collect feedback and iterate on features such as pack odds, pricing engine algorithms, vending machine integration and scanning workflows.  Plan for future expansions (e.g., adding a grading service or migrating to a permissioned blockchain) once the core system is stable.

Conclusion

This blueprint outlines how TenKings can combine the proven concepts of Courtyard’s secure vaulting and cryptographic item identificationdocs.courtyard.io with a closed-loop digital currency modelkpmg.com and an automated card-scanning pipeline to create a collectible ecosystem with instant liquidity, on-platform trading and vending machine purchases.  By maintaining TKD on an internal ledger and restricting its use to TenKings services, the platform stays compliant with closed-loop asset regulations while offering customers a seamless experience.  The scanning and ingestion integration allows TenKings to process new cards efficiently while preserving control over metadata and valuations.  The proposed architecture and development plan provide a clear roadmap for ChatGPT-5 Codex (or other development resources) to implement TenKings and deliver a secure, transparent and engaging collectible marketplace.
